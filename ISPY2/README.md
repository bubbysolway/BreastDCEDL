The public Breast DCE- MRI dataset entitled I-SPY 2 trial (Li et al., 2022; Newitt et al., 2021) ,comprises DCE-MRI data from 982 patients, acquired during the period from 2010 to 2016 across more than 22 clinical centers, all following a standardized image acquisition protocol.
 For each patient, the dataset encompasses MRI examinations at four distinct time points: pre-treatment (T0) and three subsequent MRI sessions conducted during and after the course of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC). For our study's purposes, we exclusively utilized the pre-treatment MRI scans. Furthermore, the dataset includes derived maps and segmentations generated from the DCE acquisitions. Each patient's record is enriched with histopathologic information, encompassing post-treatment functional tumor volume, pathological complete response (pCR) status, hormone receptor (HR) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status (categorized as positive or negative), MammaPrint (MP) risk level, and patient’s age at screening. Remarkably, 313 patients, constituting 32% of the cohort, achieved a pCR in response to NAC.
From a clinical perspective, the cohort demonstrates important molecular subtype distributions: 54.5% (n=537) of patients are Hormone Receptor-positive (HR+), and 24.8% (n=244) are HER2-positive. The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, a crucial measure of treatment effectiveness, was observed in 32.2% (n=317) of patients.
